The data in the json file is structured as follows (x,y,c) where (x,y) are 2d coordinates
and c in [0,1] is the intensity of tapping.
This data is naturally a path in 3D Euclidean space. We can apply the signatures to extract the features.
It is yet unclear why there is internal division in these measurements.
It might be that there are different persons tapping.
First step would be get 2D python lists where each element is a triple (x,y,c). i.e.
x_11 y_11 c_11 x_12 y_12 c_12 x_13 y_13 c_13 .....
x_21 y_21 c_21 x_22 y_22 c_22 x_23 y_23 c_23 .....
